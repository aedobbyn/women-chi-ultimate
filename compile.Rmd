## Munge

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

source("./munge.R")
# source("./model.R")

```

* Break teams into 
  + a variable `team_type` with three levels: mixed, no_club, and womens
  + a variable `club_or_not` with two levels: club and not_club

* When the outcome variable is an ordered factor (e.g., "How satisfied are you with the AMOUNT of ultimate you are currently playing?")
  + Run an ordered probit regressions with some number of predictor variables
predicting that single outcome variable

* Combine categorical variables into omnibus variables  
  + These omnibus variables are more continuous so treat them as 
  + Caveat: while directionality is constant across different variables (i.e., 1 always = bad, disagree), there are different levels for different variables that aren't necessarily comparable. They're ordered in
a way that makes the most sense, I think, but you could definitely argue for a different ordering. For example, for the question "How satisfied are you with the AMOUNT of ultimate you are currently playing?", is this the right ordering? 

"Not satisfied: wants more" < "Not satisfied: wants less" < "Neutral" < "Other" < "Somewhat satisfied: wants more" < "Somewhat satisfied: wants less" < "Very satisfied"      

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

          


## Some Visuals

```{r overall.team_type, echo = FALSE}

# jittered age (ordinal) vs. overall w/ boxplot superimposed
qplot(age, overall, data = all) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.3)


overall.team_type <- ggplot(data = all) +
  geom_bar(aes(overall, fill = team_type), position = "dodge") 
overall.team_type


womens_teams.how_long_play <- 
  ggplot(data = na.omit(all[all$team_type == "womens", ])) +
  geom_bar(aes(team, fill = how_long_play), position = "fill") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
womens_teams.how_long_play



# team_type=='womens'
ggplot(na.omit(all[all$team_type=="womens", ])) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = satis_amount_recode, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..),
               position = "fill")) +
  labs(title = "Satisfaction with Amount of Play: Womens") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop=FALSE) +     # don't drop unused levels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

# team_type=='mixed'
ggplot(na.omit(all[all$team_type=="mixed", ])) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = satis_amount_recode, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..),
               position = "fill")) +
  labs(title = "Satisfaction with Amount of Play: Mixed") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop=FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

# team_type=='no_club'
ggplot(na.omit(all[all$team_type=="no_club", ])) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = satis_amount_recode, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..),
               position = "fill")) +
  labs(title = "Satisfaction with Amount of Play: Non-Chicago Club Players") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_x_discrete(drop=FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))


```

## Models

Omnibus model with 
```{r m.big, echo=FALSE}

m.big <- lm(overall ~ 
            age + team_type + 
            currently_playing + 
            how_long_play + 
            start_playing +
            where_live,
            data = all)
```

``` {r}
summary(m.big)
```

What about the effect of team type on just satisfaction level?
Make two models, one with team_type as a predictor and one without
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ordinal)

# ------- with team_type and age predicting satis_level_recode --------
m.satis_level_team_t <- clm(satis_level_recode ~ team_type + age,
                link = "probit",
                       data = all)

# take out team type
m.satis_level_no.team_t <- clm(satis_level_recode ~ age,
                   link = "probit",
                       data = all)
```

Compare the performance of the models in predicting satisfaction level. The model with team type does't predict satisfaction level better than the one without it (p = 0.6361). So team_type is not a significant predictor of satisfaciton with the level of ultimate you're playing.
```{r}
# compare models
anova(m.satis_level_team_t, m.satis_level_no.team_t)

```

What about satisfaction with the amount of ultimate you're playing?
Same procdure.

```{r }
# ------- with team_type and age predicting satis_amount_recode ------- 
m.sais_amount_team_t <- clm(satis_amount_recode ~ team_type + age,
                link = "probit",
                data = all)
m.sais_amount_no.team_t <- clm(satis_amount_recode ~ age,
                   link = "probit",
                   data = all)
```

Model with team type DOES predict satisfaction level better than the one without it (p = 0.0072)
```{r}
anova(m.sais_amount_team_t, m.sais_amount_no.team_t)
```

Okay so there's a there there with `team_type`. So does `team_type` pedict overall satisfaction, inclusion, connection, and all of the above?


Check out how `team_type` is coded.
```{r tt_contrasts}
contrasts(all$team_type)
```

Both womens and mixed players have overall higher satisfaction and inclusion than non-club players 

Satisfaction: yes (p = 0.0252)
```{r}
m.satis_combined.team_type <- lm(satis_combined ~ team_type,
                       data = all)
summary(m.satis_combined.team_type)
```

Connection: yes (p = 1.17e-07)
```{r}
m.conn_combined.team_type <- lm(conn_combined ~ team_type,
                                 data = all)
summary(m.conn_combined.team_type)
```

Inclusion: yes (p = 0.00245)
```{r}
m.inclus_combined.team_type <- lm(inclus_combined ~ team_type,
                                 data = all)
summary(m.inclus_combined.team_type)
```

Overally: yes (p = 2.82e-07)
```{r}
m.overall.team_type <- lm(overall ~ team_type,
                                  data = all)
summary(m.overall.team_type)
```

Is there a signif difference in combined satisfaction and inclusion scores between womens and mixed players?
No, p = 0.841

```{r}
womens_and_mixed.m.overall.team_type <- lm(overall ~ team_type,
                                            data = all[all$team_type %in% c("womens", "mixed"), ])
summary(womens_and_mixed.m.overall.team_type)

```
