## Munge

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

source("./munge.R")

```

* Break teams into 
+ a variable `team_type` with three levels: mixed, no_club, and womens
+ a variable `club_or_not` with two levels: club and not_club

* When the outcome variable is an ordered factor (e.g., "How satisfied are you with the AMOUNT of ultimate you are currently playing?")
+ Run an ordered probit regressions with some number of predictor variables
predicting that single outcome variable

* Combine categorical variables into omnibus variables
+ 


## Chart

```{r overall.team_type, echo = FALSE}
overall.team_type <- ggplot(data = all) +
  geom_bar(aes(overall, fill = team_type), position = "dodge") 
overall.team_type

```
