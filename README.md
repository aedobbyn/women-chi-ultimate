### Overview

This is one analysis of an ultimate frisbee survey sent out to all women playing ultimate in the Chicagoland area shortly following the conclusion of the 2016 regular season.

The findings were presented alongside other qualitative survey research at the Women's Ultimate Frisbee summit in February, 2017.

Many thanks to Steph Landry who authored the survey, wrangled a team of us to wring answers out of the data, and used those answers to inform policy proposals aimed at increasing the participation and satisfaction of the women who play the sport.
